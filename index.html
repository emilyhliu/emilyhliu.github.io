     <h1>My Personal Top 5 Egg Dishes</h1>
     <div class="benedict">
         <h2>Eggs Benedict</h2>
         <p>An American dish consisting two halves of an English muffin, 
            each topped with Canadian bacon, a poached egg,
            and hollandaise sauce (an emulsion of egg yolk, melted butter, and lemon juice).
            I tried to make them during quaratine, and it turned out really good!
        </p>

     <div class="tea">
        <h2>Tea Egg</h2>
        <p> A traditional Chinese savory food commonly sold as a snack, 
            in which a boiled egg is cracked slightly and then boiled again in tea, sauce, and spice,
            creating this marble-like surface.
            This is one of my favorite dishes when I was a kid.
