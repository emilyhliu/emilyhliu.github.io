            as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece 
            will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, 
            while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room 
            and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein

            antiquity will strike just the <span class="hole">the ink, the fabric</span>right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.
