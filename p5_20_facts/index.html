                        The concept of déjà vu has been around since French philosopher and researcher Émile Boirac coined the term in 1876

                        or associated with other symptoms such as hallucinations, may be an indicator of neurological or psychiatric illness

                            People also tend to experience déjà vu more in fragile conditions or under high pressure, 
                            and research shows that the experience of déjà vu also decreases with age.

                            Certain drugs increase the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, 
                            resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.

                        Déjà vu may happen if a person experienced the current sensory twice successively. 
                        The first input experience is brief, degraded, occluded, or distracted. Immediately following that, 
                        the second perception might be familiar because the person naturally related it to the first input.

                        When people experience déjà vu, they may have their recognition memory triggered by certain situations which they have never encountered.

                        Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of déjà vu is the occurrence of "cryptomnesia", 
                        which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, 
                        and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, 
                        leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, 
                        known as "déjà vu".

                            Dream-based explanation[edit] Dreams can also be used to explain the experience of déjà vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some déjà vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). Twenty per cent of the respondents reported their déjà vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience déjà vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown. Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and déjà vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience déjà vu during a dream state, which links déjà vu with dream frequency.

                            A 2012 study in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, that used virtual reality technology to study reported déjà vu experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the déjà vu experience.

                            Déjà vu is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. 
                            The brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere.
                            However, signals enter the temporal lobe twice before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, 
                            normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them.
                            They would be processed as two separate experiences, 
                            with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.

                        Déjà vécu (from French, meaning "already lived") is an intense, but false, feeling of having already lived through the present situation. Recently, it has been considered a pathological form of déjà vu.

                        Déjà entendu (literally "already heard") is the experience of feeling sure about having already heard something, even though the exact details are uncertain or were perhaps imagined.
