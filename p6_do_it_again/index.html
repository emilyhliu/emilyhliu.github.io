                                    Iridescence (also known as goniochromism) is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear to gradually change color as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. 
                                    Examples of iridescence include soap bubbles, feathers, butterfly wings and seashell nacre, as well as certain minerals. 
                                    It is often created by structural coloration (microstructures that interfere with light).

                                    The word iridescence is derived in part from the Greek word iris meaning rainbow, 
                                    and is combined with the Latin suffix -escent, meaning "having a tendency toward".

                                Many groups of plants have developed iridescence as an adaptation to use more light in dark environments such as the lower levels of tropical forests.

                                The feathers of birds such as kingfishers, birds-of-paradise,hummingbirds, parrots, starlings, grackles, ducks, and peacocks are iridescent.

                                Pearlescence is an effect related to iridescence and has a similar cause. Structures within a surface cause light to be reflected back, but in the case of pearlescence some or all of the light is white.
